    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we analyze the impact of datatypes on basic operations, accumulation with addition and subtraction, of data we intend to represent monetary quantities. We execute calculations with `int`s, `long`s, `float`s, and `double`s that represent what might be reflective of totalling up transactions and payments, and study how the number of amounts to aggregate impacts accuracy. We don't consider operations, like taking taxes or interest using percents, that would either _require_ floating point or perfect rational math. For now, we keep it simple and limited to adding things up and ask mainly about \"how many\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically our goal is to investigate if and when floating point numbers can accurately reflect the true results of such calculations, in cents. We pack `int`s in too, because there's a general question about the space required to store the results of the calculations we do. In this work we don't care whether the floating point representations themselves, in all their precision, match a true value in cents. Spoiler: they won't. We only care that those floating point values, _when rounded to cents_ , _then_ match the true value. This is possible with `double`s, but not `float`s, although depending on the size of the accumulations we might need to use specific summation methods for `double`s (that aren't at all hard to program). If that holds, then we have some assurance that `double` datatypes can serve as an effective intermediary, at least: if we can persist `long int` data, manipulate it with `double`s (so long as this is convenient), and store it back as `long int` _correctly_ then we basically never lose precision _in the units we care about_ (here presumed to be cents). \n",
    "\n",
    "Our numerical experiments suggest `double`s are fine in this lens for sums of hundreds of thousands or even millions of actually pretty large amounts. Our experimental analysis is, obviously and inevitably, dependent on the assumptions we make in formulating it. We also undertake a theoretical analysis that provides _guarantees_ that `double`s are fine, under our assumptions for drawing amounts, for aggregations of tens of thousands of amounts. If we're careful about how we sum amounts up, guaranteed accuracy of aggregations extends to the millions of amounts. And all under kind of silly assumptions that generate rather large amounts which, if relaxed, would further increase the number of amounts we could aggregate with a guarantee of correctness in cents. \n",
    "\n",
    "A super important point to note is that, these days, \"`double` is often the default\". In particular, [`python` floats are doubles](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html) (unless you say otherwise), and I've even heard that \"under the hood\" single-precision `float` calculations are done in 64B (`double`) hardware (and I would love either a correction or a reference). We have to explicitly store `double` data in our databases to keep the precision, though this is really more about storing 8 bytes rather than 4. Point is that while amounts are being used it's probably not an awful mistake to just presume some automagic has put double precision to work for you. And definitely never use single precision. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also review some basics about floating point representation, including spooky edge cases, but mainly to mediate those with results guaranteeing precision in our particular case. More or less, the takeaway here is use 8 bytes (8B) in either `long int` or `double` form and you're good. But _nothing's ever so simple as that kind of soundbite_ , and I hope this article also displays some of the exciting complexities involved here. "

This is larger even than the largest (4B) `int`, which is our input type for $N$, so we completely ignore this. The code wouldn't run anyway; storing an \"amount\" in our sense costs 36B, and 900T amounts would take something like 31,000GB of RAM. To run in under 1GB of memory we need about $N \\leq 29,826,162$ which still represents a rather large (daily) amount accumulation. For a bit of [reference](https://www.statista.com/statistics/261327/number-of-per-card-credit-card-transactions-worldwide-by-brand-as-of-2011/), in 2019 worldwide, Visa and Mastercard together had on average 401,369,863 transactions a day worldwide, and Amex had about 21,917,808 transactions a day.

    "\n",
    "The code writes a `csv` file, named `results.csv` by default, with a line for each trial using distinct random amounts. There are columns for each non-exact value -- `int` cents, `float` cents, `float` dollars, `double` cents, and `double` dollars --  with a `0` if the result is wrong (relative to `long int`) and `1` if it is correct. \n",

    "`double`s, also 8 bytes but subject to roundoff error, are also probably fine too. We saw no errors in tests using `double`s pegged to cents, but some errors for \"very large\" sums of (millions of) uniformly-signed amounts pegged to dollars, but not for mixed sign sums. Moreover, if we trust the gurus of numerical analysis in the presence of round-off errors (which we should), there are actual theoretical guarantees of the correctness of using `double`s for tens of thousands of summands with naive summation code and at least tens of millions of summands, if not billions, with smarter code. Both theoretical conclusions are justified by numerical experiments. "
